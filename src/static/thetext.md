Our story begins on a winter morning. There is fog and cold. The children go to school. Marco and his friends walk in a line on the walkways above the water.

# 2

Schoolchildren who live far away arrive by gondola. And all the children look down and see the water rising more every day.

# 3

At school, the teacher is telling the story of Venice. Venice was born on the sea, she says. A long time ago Venice was one of the most important cities in Italy. Its boats traveled far away and the merchants brought back lots of precious objects like gold, silk and spices. Thus Venice soon became very rich and very powerful and its inhabitants wanted to live in wonderful palaces. To protect the city from the waters of the sea, they thought of building the houses, the churches, the port and the monuments on stilts, i.e. on huge wooden poles planted one by one on the bottom of the lagoon. And they were right, because, over the centuries, Venice with its narrow streets, churches, bridges and small squares, and its beautiful houses, Venice with its gondolas, canals, arcades and statues, with its beautiful balconies... Venice was like a dream, like a paradise placed above the water. But one bad day the sea began to rise and, little by little, despite the stilt houses, the sea grew between the houses. One day, Venice will be completely covered in water. One day, Venice will disappear forever at the bottom of the sea..." The children listen attentively and the teacher adds: "Take pencil and paper, brushes and colors... try to imagine what Venice will be like tomorrow... Try to draw Venice under the sea!"

It's nighttime. Marco, in his little bed, thinks about his drawing. In the foreground he painted a little mermaid, and in the background Venice, lying under the sea. Suddenly, someone knocks on the window. It’s a little mermaid, who says to Marco: "Thank you for putting me in your picture! But you've never seen Venice at the bottom of the sea... I've come to get you to show you!" Marco is amazed... behind the glass is the sea, you can see algae and little fish! "Put on this suit and fins and scuba mask, says the little mermaid, so you'll swim more easily!"

# 5

Marco and the little mermaid are now swimming in the night. Marco turns on a flashlight to see, in the dark, cuttlefish, jellyfish, luminous fish, sea anemones, sea urchins and blue algae...

# 6

Suddenly a bush of seaweed opens up and Venice appears. Marco recognizes the wonders of the city: the King Palace, San Marco Square, the Clock Tower... "It's not possible! he exclaims, it's not possible!" "But yes, replies the little mermaid, let's dive deeper and I'll show you how beautiful it is to live at the bottom of the sea!

# 7

As they go, they see strange fish swimming around them, and lobsters and seaweeds and long swaying plants. Then they swim over a large white monument. "This is the church of St Mary, which was built many, many years ago, as a sign of thanksgiving, when the great plague epidemic in Venice ended. But let's go to see the church of San Marco. It is the most beautiful one! In front of the church there is a large square, where all the people of Venice meet, as they always have. But now, they also encounter flying fish and seahorses and shells scattered among the clumps of black seaweed.

# 8

How beautiful San Marco is! How beautiful! Domes, arches and portals, bell towers, turrets and shrines! And the four bronze horses, tired of always standing still and watching, every now and then run off to play hide and seek in the midst of the seaweed with the mullet and jellyfish. And down there, deep down, they can see some children who have brought food to their little fish friends.

# 9

"Let's go into the church," says the little mermaid. Inside, everything is golden: the crosses and the candlesticks, the lamps and the mosaics that cover every wall. Even the seaweeds shine like gold and form festoons of splendid embroidery.

# 10

Then Marco and the little mermaid arrive in front of the King palace.

# 11

It was once the palace where the King family lived, the most powerful people in the whole city. Today, no one lives inside the building anymore. Algae have become the landlords, red algae and corals swaying in the dark like tongues of flame. Marco turns on the flashlight, and in a corner he discovers the octopus Polifemo, the guardian of the building, who plays cards by himself to pass the time. He has so many arms, he can't remember which cards he holds in each hand, so he can't cheat! "Let's go, says Marco. Let's go over there too and play at Hopscotch!" And there he is jumping together with the mermaid, together with the fish, the girls and the boys!

# 12

Now the two friends arrive in the Market Square.”Fish! Fresh fish! Freshly caught fish!" shout the fishermen behind the stalls around which people crowd to do their shopping. "Look, Marco! says the little mermaid, look at those children who play with the skipping rope and play marbles and throw the ball. Look! a peacock fish! And that funny gentleman who tries to catch some butterfly fish with his net..." In front of them, children and little fish compete in races on the spiral staircase of a very special palace, which looks like a large corkscrew...

# 13

Further down, they discover another strange palace. What are those numbers on the wall? Asks Marco. The numbers show the water level, replies the little mermaid. Since Venice began to sink, every year they have marked the level of the water. See those workers on the roof? They repair the tiles. There are many people, technicians, engineers, scientists who continue to work stubbornly to preserve Venice, just as it was. Who knows! Perhaps one day the water will go away, the fish, jellyfish and octopuses will disappear and Venice will return to life as before!" As Marco passes by, he sees that everything in the houses hasn’t changed at all. The children stare wide-eyed at the television, a little boy is crying while he takes his bath, a boy puts a large shell on his ear and he seems to hear the sound of the wind and the cries of seagulls flying in the clouds...

# 14

And here is the cathedral of Saints John and Paul; just as Marco and the little mermaid arrive, a wedding is being celebrated there.

# 15 

After the ceremony, the bride and groom leave by gondola. The little bridesmaids smile at everyone and wave flowers. The gondolier sings a song as the fish dance around them. All the people look out the windows to greet and smile from the arcades by the canal. Children hold on to the jellyfish and octopuses and follow the bride and groom's gondola, while all the prawns and sea urchins, algae and shells stop to watch..

# 16

The newlyweds are now long gone. Now the children accompany Marco and the little mermaid to a large colorful room full of beautiful paintings of great value.

# 17

The sea water is damaging all the colors and so all the best painters work continuously to restore them, to redo the parts that have become damaged. They use all the colors of the sea: many gray blues and greens, all coral pinks and purples of anemones, the yellows of the sand, the reds and golds. When the pictures have been well restored, they are taken back to the museums so that all the people can admire them.

# 18

Marco is really excited. How many wonders, how many beautiful things! "But can't you do anything to save Venice?" he asks his friends who live under the sea. "No, we can't do anything here any more, the children answer, but you, Marco, you who live up there, you have to tell people to come and help us, you have to tell people not to wait. We've been waiting for so long come and save!" Marco is moved and promises he will help them. And the children give him a nice round vase with two small goldfish swimming at the bottom. Marco and the little mermaid go up slowly, the children and the fish follow them for a little while. Then Marco finds himself in his bedroom. "Goodbye, goodbye!, says the little mermaid, one day we will meet again!.

# 19

In the morning, when he wakes up, Marco finds the round vase with the fish on his bedside table and remembers Venice at the bottom of the sea! Was it a real trip or just a dream? Marco tries to remember, but his memories come and go like the two fish at the bottom of the vase... Only one thing he remembers well: that he too promised to help all those who are trying to save Venice.
