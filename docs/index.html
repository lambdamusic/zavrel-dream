					<p class="lead">At school, the teacher is telling the story of Venice. Venice was born on the sea, she says. A long time ago Venice was one of the most important cities in Italy. Its boats traveled far away and the merchants brought back lots of precious objects like gold, silk and spices. Thus Venice soon became very rich and very powerful and its inhabitants wanted to live in wonderful palaces. To protect the city from the waters of the sea, they thought of building the houses, the churches, the port and the monuments on stilts, i.e. on huge wooden poles planted one by one on the bottom of the lagoon. And they were right, because, over the centuries, Venice with its narrow streets, churches, bridges and small squares, and its beautiful houses, Venice with its gondolas, canals, arcades and statues, with its beautiful balconies... Venice was like a dream, like a paradise placed above the water. But one bad day the sea began to rise and, little by little, despite the stilt houses, the sea grew between the houses. One day, Venice will be completely covered in water. One day, Venice will disappear forever at the bottom of the sea...&quot; The children listen attentively and the teacher adds: &quot;Take pencil and paper, brushes and colors... try to imagine what Venice will be like tomorrow... Try to draw Venice under the sea!&quot;</p>

Suddenly, someone knocks on the window. It’s a little mermaid, who says to Marco: &quot;Thank you for putting me in your picture! But you&#39;ve never seen Venice at the bottom of the sea... I&#39;ve come to get you to show you!&quot; Marco is amazed... behind the glass is the sea, you can see algae and little fish! &quot;Put on this suit and fins and scuba mask, says the little mermaid, so you&#39;ll swim more easily!&quot;</p>

Then they swim over a large white monument. &quot;This is the church of St Mary, which was built many, many years ago, as a sign of thanksgiving, when the great plague epidemic in Venice ended. But let&#39;s go to see the church of San Marco. It is the most beautiful one! In front of the church there is a large square, where all the people of Venice meet, as they always have. But now, they also encounter flying fish and seahorses and shells scattered among the clumps of black seaweed.</p>

And the four bronze horses, tired of always standing still and watching, every now and then run off to play hide and seek in the midst of the seaweed with the mullet and jellyfish. And down there, deep down, they can see some children who have brought food to their little fish friends.</p>

Algae have become the landlords, red algae and corals swaying in the dark like tongues of flame. Marco turns on the flashlight, and in a corner he discovers the octopus Polifemo, the guardian of the building, who plays cards by himself to pass the time. He has so many arms, he can&#39;t remember which cards he holds in each hand, so he can&#39;t cheat! &quot;Let&#39;s go, says Marco. Let&#39;s go over there too and play at Hopscotch!&quot; And there he is jumping together with the mermaid, together with the fish, the girls and the boys!</p>

Freshly caught fish!&quot; shout the fishermen behind the stalls around which people crowd to do their shopping. &quot;Look, Marco! says the little mermaid, look at those children who play with the skipping rope and play marbles and throw the ball. Look! a peacock fish! And that funny gentleman who tries to catch some butterfly fish with his net...&quot; In front of them, children and little fish compete in races on the spiral staircase of a very special palace, which looks like a large corkscrew...</p>

Since Venice began to sink, every year they have marked the level of the water. See those workers on the roof? They repair the tiles. There are many people, technicians, engineers, scientists who continue to work stubbornly to preserve Venice, just as it was. Who knows! Perhaps one day the water will go away, the fish, jellyfish and octopuses will disappear and Venice will return to life as before!&quot; As Marco passes by, he sees that everything in the houses hasn’t changed at all. The children stare wide-eyed at the television, a little boy is crying while he takes his bath, a boy puts a large shell on his ear and he seems to hear the sound of the wind and the cries of seagulls flying in the clouds...</p>

We&#39;ve been waiting for so long come and save!&quot; Marco is moved and promises he will help them. And the children give him a nice round vase with two small goldfish swimming at the bottom.
